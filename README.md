# DJITello-Learning-Courses

This repository contains numerous learning courses pertaining to flying the DJI Tello drones, using the DJITelloPy API and of course, Python to control the drones.

These courses were constructed to educate students on not only how to fly these drones, but to also learn how to code in Python with straightforward functions. It's like killing two birds with one stone.
